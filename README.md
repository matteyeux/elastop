# Elastop - Elasticsearch Terminal Dashboard

Elastop is a terminal-based dashboard for monitoring Elasticsearch clusters in real-time. It provides a comprehensive view of cluster health, node status, indices, and various performance metrics in an easy-to-read terminal interface. This tool was designed to look visually similar HTOP.
